./This page will help you to add a game libray!








 It is possible for you to create a new game library. To do this, you must create a child class
  and implement all the methods from the arc::IGame interface class.\n
  You can use the arc::ArcadeError for your exceptions as they are catched by
  the core of the Arcade.
